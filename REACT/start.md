npm install

When we run the command npm install in a directory where a package.json file is present, npm reads the names of each dependency from the package.json file and downloads the packages from npmjs.com (Links to an external site.), where they are hosted

node_modules If you are working in a local environment, running npm install creates a folder called node_modules, which contains all the downloaded packages.

npm has a built-in command, npm init, that we can use to create the package.json file.
